## Refunds
Refunds are handled on a case-by-case basis. Typically, we do not offer refunds for Pay-As-You-Use Services. Note that if you have used at least $0.10 of your purchased credits, you are <b>INELIGIBLE</b> for a refund.

Please note that Pay-As-You-Use Services incur charges at the time of purchase or recharge. It is crucial to ensure that all information entered is accurate before completing the transaction. You are encouraged to review your details carefully to avoid any discrepancies.

While we strive to provide the best service possible, refunds may be considered in exceptional circumstances, such as technical errors or service disruptions beyond your control. In such cases, please reach out to our support team for assistance. More specific examples of such exceptional circumstances include, but are not limited to:
- Technical errors* preventing access to paid features but charged you for it.
- Service disruptions** caused by server issues that charged you without providing any AI response.
- Inadvertent overcharges or incorrect billing.

Any fraudulent attempts to request refunds or initiate chargebacks will result in immediate inclusion on Nyatastic's blacklist. Should such fraudulent activities occur, law enforcement authorities will be contacted and involved as necessary.

If you want to request a refund, please join our [Support server](https://discord.gg/zUjrHU4hVd) or email us at [support@nekogirl.net](mailto:support@nekogirl.net). As stated above, Refunds are handled on a case-by-case basis. You should prepare necessary evidence to back your refund request up such as receipts and any other evidence to back you up.

`* = The Chatbot charged you for the request, but it failed to generate a response (404). We will reimburse you on a case-by-case basis, as sometimes the question you ask will trigger our filter, causing a 404 response.`

`** = While using the Chatbot, Nyatastic had a server restart, or downtime which caused your credits to be used but no response came out of it due to the disruption. In this case, please contact support and we will reimburse you the amount.`
